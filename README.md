It allows to simplify the implementation of using NLog by utilising [ILoggerFactory](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging) and [ILogger](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging) interfaces in an application.

[NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog) is a flexible and free logging platform for various .NET platforms, including .NET standard. NLog makes it easy to write to several targets. (database, file, console) and change the logging configuration on-the-fly.
